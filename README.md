# FaithfulOpenSyobonAction
Fork of OpenSyobonAction to make it closer to the original v0.8 version.  

OpenSyobonAction is very close to the original version of the game, however there are a few things that need to be changed to make it closer to the original.  
Some of these include:  
- [x] Fix some textures not being displayed correctly.
- [ ] Fix black lines appearing below sprites that are facing backwards (Linux issue I think).
- [ ] Make the chicken at the end of 1-4 kill you.
- [ ] Set background color in title screen (fixes black background when exiting from underground and castle levels)
- [ ] Set font weight to match v0.8.
- [ ] Showing short black screen between subareas.
 
This project is one of the first actually kinda large projects I'm working on, it might be a while before it's any close to finished.  
PRs welcome.
